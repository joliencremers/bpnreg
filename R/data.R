#'The geometry of human knowledge of navigation space.
#'
#'A dataset from a study by Warren et.al. (2017) on the geometry of human
#'knowledge of navigation space.
#'
#'In their study Warren et.al. (2017) conduct an experiment in which a total of
#'20 participants used virtual reality headsets to navigate through one of two
#'versions of a virtual maze. One version of the maze is the standard or
#'Euclidean maze. The other version of the maze, the non-Euclidean maze, has
#'exactly the same layout as the standard maze apart from that it contains
#'wormholes by which participants can be 'teleported' from one place in the maze
#'to another.
#'
#'In a training phase participants had learned to navigate between different
#'pairs of start and target objects in one of two versions of the maze. The
#'number of trials each participants completed in this training phase was
#'recorded.
#'
#'In the test phase of the experiment participants first walked to a start
#'object. When they had reached this object the maze dissappeared and only a
#'"textured groundplane" of the maze remained visible. The participants then
#'turned toward the location of the target object that they had remembered
#'during the training phase and started to walk toward the target. The angular
#'difference, angular error, between the initial walking direction of a
#'participant from the start object and the location of the target object was
#'recorded as an outcome variable in the experiment.The angular error is a
#'circular variable and can be described and analyzed using circular statistics.
#'
#'Apart from the between-subjects factor, the type of maze, the experiment also
#'included a within-subjects factor, trial number. All participants had to
#'complete 8 trials in the test phase of the experiment. In each of these trials
#'they had to walk to a specific target object. An additional within-subjects
#'factor is the type of target object. Pairs of start and target objects were of
#'two types: probe and standard. The probe objects were located near the
#'entrance and exit of a wormhole whereas the standard objects were located at
#'some distance from the wormholes. For each of these two types of objects
#'participants had to find 4 different targets resulting in a total of 8 trials
#'per participant.

#' Phase differences in hand flexion-extension movements.
#'
#' A dataset from a study by Puglisi et.al. (2017) on the role of attention in
#' human motor resonance.
#'
#' In their research Puglisi et.al. (2017) conduct a between subjects experiment
#' in which `observers' in multiple degrees of explicitness are asked to look at
#' the movement of a hand of the `mover' or other object in order to evaluate
#' the role of attention in motor resonant response.
#'
#' The experiment has four conditions:
#'
#' 1. The `explicit observation' condition (n = 14), where observers are
#' explicitly instructed to observe the hand.
#'
#' 2. The `semi-implicit observation' condition (n = 14) where the observers
#' have to do a task that requires implicit observation of the hand.
#'
#' 3. The `implicit observation' condition (n = 14), where observers have to do
#' a task that is independent of the observation of the hand that is moving in
#' front of them.
#'
#' 4. A baseline condition (n=14) where there is no moving hand but observers
#' have to look at an inanimate object that moves in an identical manner to the
#' hand.
#'
#' The idea of motor resonance is then that the `observer', because they are
#' looking explicitly or implicitly at the hand of the `mover', starts moving
#' his or her hand in the same manner. This is the resonant response. In each
#' condition the hand movements of the observers were measured and the phase
#' difference between the observers' hand and the hand they observed (the
#' movers' hand) was calculated. This was not done for the baseline condition
#' because in this condition there was no periodic pattern of movement in the
#' `observers' hand.
#'
#' The phase difference is a circular variable and can be described and analyzed
#' using circular statistics.
