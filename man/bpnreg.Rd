\description{
This package contains functions to analyze circular regression type models
(multivariate and mixed-effects). It is based on the 'embedding' approach to
circular modelling and makes use of the projected normal distribution. Its
estimation method is a Bayesian MCMC sampler. Further technical details can
be found in Cremers, Mulder & Klugkist (2018) and Cremers & Klugkist (2017,
under review).
}
\details{
A tutorial on how to use this package can be found in Cremers & Klugkist
(2017, under review). More details on the sampling algorithm and
interpretation of the coefficients from the model can be found in Cremers,
Mulder & Klugkist (2018) and Cremers, Mainhard & Klugkist (in press).

\section{Functions}{
 The main functions of the package are:

  \code{\link{bpnr}}, which runs an MCMC sampler in \code{C++} and returns an
  S3 object of type \code{bpnr}, which can be further analyzed through
  associated functions.

  \code{\link{bpnme}}, which runs an MCMC sampler in \code{R} and returns an
  S3 object of type \code{bpnme}, which can be further analyzed through
  associated functions.
}

\section{Datasets}{
 Datasets included in this package are:

  \code{\link{Motor}}, A dataset from a study by Puglisi et.al. (2017) on the
  role of attention in human motor resonance.

  \code{\link{Maps}}, A dataset from a study by Warren et.al. (2017) on the
  geometry of human knowledge of navigation space.
